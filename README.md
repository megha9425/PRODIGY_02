Develop a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation. This program provides a basic yet effective way to encrypt and decrypt images using pixel manipulation techniques. It allows users to secure their pictures by applying operations such as pixel value swapping or mathematical transformations.
Below is a simple Python script using the Pillow library for image processing. Make sure to install Pillow first if you haven't already: pip install pillow This script uses a simple encryption and decryption process. You can customize this method or explore other pixel manipulation techniques for more robust encryption.
